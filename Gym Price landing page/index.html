                        <p class=" text-center">Fitness is not about being better than someone else; it's about being better than you used to be,
                            The gym is where excuses go to die and champions are born,
                            Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out,Train like a beast, look like a beauty.
                            Your only limit is you. Break through the barriers and exceed your own expectations,The body achieves what the mind believes
                            In the gym, pain is just weakness leaving the body,Sweat is fat crying. Make it weep,Fitness is not a destination; it's a journey without a finish line
                            Strength does not come from the body; it comes from the will to push beyond perceived limits.</p>

                <p class="my-2">A one-hour workout is only 4% of your day. No excuses,Don't wish for a good body; work for it,The difference between try and triumph is a little 'umph
                    Your body can withstand almost anything. It's your mind you have to convince,Excuses don't burn calories,
                    The gym is my therapy; sweat is my medicine,Fitness is not just about the body; it's also about the mind and the soul,
                    You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great,Every workout is a step closer to your goals. Stay consistent, stay committed,
                    Fitness is not a hobby; it's a lifestyle. Embrace the grind, and let the results speak for themselves.</p>
